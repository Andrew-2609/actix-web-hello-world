# Actix Web Hello World

This project contains simple Rust code implemented throughout the [Basics](https://actix.rs/docs/getting-started) section of the Actix Web framework.

I didn't bother creating separate files/crates for each topic, so the whole implementation was made at `src/main.rs`, and it's contained in this file's history. This repo has 99.99% of chance of being useless to you, I just aimed to register my progress in the framework's documentation!
